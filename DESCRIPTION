Package: HiCBricks
Title: Framework for Storing and Accessing Hi-C Data Through HDF Files
Version: 1.5.0
Description: HiCBricks is a library designed for handling large high-resolution Hi-C datasets. Over the years, the Hi-C field has experienced a rapid increase in the size and complexity of datasets. HiCBricks is meant to overcome the challenges related to the analysis of such large datasets within the R environment. HiCBricks offers user-friendly and efficient solutions for handling large high-resolution Hi-C datasets. The package provides an R/Bioconductor framework with the bricks to build more complex data analysis pipelines and algorithms. HiCBricks already incorporates example algorithms for calling domain boundaries and functions for high quality data visualization.
